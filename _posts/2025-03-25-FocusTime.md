Or the biology teacher explaining you about the life cycle  of a butterfly. If you lookback those days, if you really had concentrated, those concepts will remain in your memories like a fossil on a sedimentary rock. And as years goes most of us have come across many difficult theorems, principals chemical formula etc which needs more concentration and focus. The usage of iOT have paved way to learn more things, but the time one concetrates/focuses on a single concept is alarmingly reducing.
